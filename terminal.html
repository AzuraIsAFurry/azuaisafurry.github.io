            The old dusty crt screen beeps to life as you wipe away the dust, accidently pressing down a key, you're prompted to enter a username and password.
            <br>
            <br>
            You enter the credentials into the old terminal, it takes a second to load, but eventually boots up.
            <br>
            <br>
            The blue of the old Windows XP background fills your room, you sheild your eyes for a second as they slowly adjust to the flash of light in your dark room.
            <br>
            <br>
            The fans spin to life, the nostalgia fills you as you begin to click around. 
            <br>
            <br>
            You open the file explorer, noticing a lack of space on the admitely small hard drive, opening it, you see a folder labeled "documents".
            <br>
            <br>
            You open the folder.
