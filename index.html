            <h2>About me!</h2>
            <p>
                Howdy, name's Azura. I like to write, sometimes, even if they're bad. I also like to learn code,
                at the moment i'm only actively learning HTML, but I am trying to learn C#, mostly for game development
                purposes such as unity. 
                <br>
                <br>
                However I also like to create renders in Blender, I'll post some here for anyone that sees this!
                <br>
                <br>
                Below are some options you to look at, such as my sonas, my renders, and maybe project links if I make anything I deem worthy enough to be seen.
