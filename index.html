            <h2>About me!</h2>
            Howdy, name's Azura. I like to write, sometimes, even if they're bad. I also like to learn code,
            at the moment i'm only actively learning HTML, but I am trying to learn C#, mostly for game development
            purposes such as unity. 
            <br>
            <br>
            However I also like to create renders in Blender, I'll post some here for anyone that sees this!
            <br>
            <br>
            Below are some options you to look at, such as my sonas, my renders, and maybe project links if I make anything I deem worthy enough to be seen.
