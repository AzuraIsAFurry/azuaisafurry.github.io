                        <b>Gaxle</b> was born into the <b>Gettle</b> family. 
                        The Gettle being a well known, and well respected family of perfectly 
                        trained assasains, born, bred, and raised to kill without
                        failure. <b>Gaxle</b> is usually most proficient with meelee 
                        weapons, but can perform just aswell with ranged weapons,
                        usually snipers, or powerful handguns, his favorite being the
                        Desert Eagle mark XIX, with hollow point rounds. With <b>Gaxle's</b>
                        fast movement, and sharp hearing, he can usually predict his
                        opponents movement, but he's not always perfect, he can be
                        tricked quite easily, however, he is a fast learner.
