            Everything always starts out amazing, the it gets harder, and harder, and harder
            I don't know why we thought this project would work, it was an obviously stupid idea.
            Enter a blackhole? Why? Because we're curious? We're sinking millions of dollars
            and materials, just to fucking lose it all, fan-fucking-tastic. The one good thing that's 
            coming out of this, Deminal III. I'm taking this code and I'm running off with it, good luck
            to whatever poor soul has to go on this mission.
